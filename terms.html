    <h2>6. Wine Recommendations</h2>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <h3>Important Disclaimer</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Unwyned provides wine recommendations based on your stated preferences and algorithmic matching.
        These are SUGGESTIONS, not guarantees.</strong>
      </p>
      <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
        <li>We do not guarantee you will like any recommended wine</li>
        <li>Taste is subjective; our recommendations may not match your expectations</li>
        <li>Wine information is sourced from third parties and may contain errors</li>
        <li>Prices shown are estimates and may not reflect current retail prices</li>
        <li>We are not responsible for the quality, authenticity, or safety of wines you purchase</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>7. Responsible Drinking</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Drink responsibly.</strong> Unwyned is a wine discovery tool, not a license to overconsume.
      You are solely responsible for your alcohol consumption and its consequences.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Never drink and drive</li>
      <li>Know your limits</li>
      <li>Obey all local laws regarding alcohol purchase and consumption</li>
      <li>Consult a physician if you have health concerns related to alcohol</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The App may integrate with third-party services (App Store, Google Play, wine retailers). We are not
      responsible for the content, accuracy, or practices of these third parties. Your use of third-party
      services is governed by their own terms and policies.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Subscriptions and In-App Purchases</h2>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <h3>Apple App Store Subscriptions</h3>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
        Unwyned offers optional premium features through in-app purchases. All payments are processed
        securely through Apple's App Store. We do not have access to your payment information.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>9.1 Available Purchases</h3>
    <p>Unwyned offers the following in-app purchase options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Made Man (Lifetime):</strong> A one-time purchase that grants permanent access to all
        premium features. This is not a subscription and does not auto-renew.</li>
      <li><strong>Protection Money (Monthly):</strong> A monthly auto-renewable subscription that provides
        access to all premium features for the duration of your subscription.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>9.2 Subscription Pricing</h3>
    <p>
      Current pricing is displayed in the App at the time of purchase. Prices may vary by region and are
      shown in your local currency. Prices are subject to change, but any changes will not affect active
      subscription periods.
    </p>

    <h3>9.3 Auto-Renewal Terms</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Protection Money (Monthly) is an auto-renewable subscription.</strong> This means:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your subscription will automatically renew each month unless you cancel</li>
      <li>You must cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period to avoid being
        charged for the next period</li>
      <li>Your Apple ID account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the
        current period</li>
      <li>The renewal price will be the same as the original subscription price unless we notify you
        of a price change</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>9.4 Billing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase</li>
      <li>All billing is handled by Apple. We do not store or have access to your payment details</li>
      <li>For billing inquiries, contact Apple Support or review your purchase history in your
        Apple ID account settings</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>9.5 How to Cancel Your Subscription</h3>
    <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time through your Apple ID account settings:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iPhone or iPad</li>
      <li>Tap your name at the top, then tap <strong>Subscriptions</strong></li>
      <li>Select <strong>Unwyned</strong> from the list of subscriptions</li>
      <li>Tap <strong>Cancel Subscription</strong> and confirm</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Alternatively, you can manage subscriptions through the App Store app under your account settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Important:</strong> Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period.
      You will continue to have access to premium features until your subscription expires. Uninstalling
      the app does not cancel your subscription.
    </p>

    <h3>9.6 Refunds</h3>
    <p>
      All purchases are final. Refunds are handled by Apple in accordance with their refund policies.
      To request a refund, visit <a href="https://reportaproblem.apple.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportaproblem.apple.com</a>
      or contact Apple Support directly.
    </p>

    <h3>9.7 Free Trials</h3>
    <p>
      If a free trial is offered, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when
      you purchase a subscription. You will not be charged during the free trial period, but your
      subscription will automatically convert to a paid subscription at the end of the trial unless
      you cancel at least 24 hours before the trial ends.
    </p>

    <h3>9.8 Restoring Purchases</h3>
    <p>
      If you reinstall the app or switch devices, you can restore your previous purchases by signing
      in with the same Apple ID and tapping "Restore Purchases" in the app. Lifetime purchases and
      active subscriptions will be restored automatically.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, INCEPTYON LABS LLC SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
      INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE APP.
    </p>
    <p>
      IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS (OR $50 IF
      YOU HAVEN'T PAID ANYTHING).
    </p>

    <h2>13. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>
      You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Inceptyon Labs LLC from any claims, damages, or expenses
      (including legal fees) arising from your use of the App, your violation of these Terms, or your
      violation of any third-party rights.
    </p>

    <h2>14. Changes to the Service</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the App (or any part of it) at any time, with
      or without notice. We are not liable for any such changes.
    </p>

    <h2>15. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms from time to time. Significant changes will be communicated via the App or
      email. Continued use of the App after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>16. Governing Law</h2>

      These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Florida, United States, without regard to
      conflict of law principles.
    </p>

    <h2>17. Dispute Resolution</h2>

    <h3>17.1 Informal Resolution</h3>
    <p>
      If you have a dispute, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@unwyned.com">support@unwyned.com</a> first.
      We'll try to resolve it informally.
    </p>

    <h3>17.2 Arbitration</h3>
    <p>
      If informal resolution fails, disputes will be resolved through binding arbitration under the rules of
      the American Arbitration Association, rather than in court. You waive your right to participate in
      class-action lawsuits.
    </p>

    <h2>18. Severability</h2>
    <p>
      If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will
      remain in full effect.
